Check Eligibility for Premium Membership

Problem Statement:
A company offers premium membership to customers based on the following criteria:

The customer must be at least 18 years old.
Their monthly income should be greater than or equal to ₹30,000.
They should not have any pending dues.
Write a program that uses relational, logical, and ternary operators to check if a customer is eligible for premium membership. Use appropriate keywords, identifiers, and access modifiers for the program.

Requirements:
Take the following inputs from the user:
Age (integer)
Monthly Income (double)
Pending Dues (boolean: true if there are dues, otherwise false)
Use a ternary operator to determine and display the customer's eligibility status.
Ensure proper handling of variable declarations, data types, and access modifiers.

Input:
Enter your age: 25
Enter your monthly income: 40000
Do you have pending dues (true/false): false

Output:
You are eligible for premium membership.
